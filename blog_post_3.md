While reading The Egyptian Gazette I noticed that crime reports were frequently posted. Murdering, stealing, kidnapping, and riots filled many of the cities in the 1900’s. After taking a deeper look at these reports I was able to come across some interesting findings. First off, many of the murders happened in a savagery manner. For example a man slew his victim with a knife before sunset, and after killing him, he cut his fingers and stabbed his dead body in nine different places. I also discovered that most killings were executed with a firearm, a revolver to be exact. Finally, a few of the murderers were reported showing no remorse for their victims as they were “quoting verses and asking for a cigarette before mounting the ‘gallows.” As for the punishment for these crimes, it mostly depended on the severity of offense. Punishments varied from hard labor to prison time to execution at the highest level. I also read that executions were moved from a public standpoint to happening inside the walls of the prisons.

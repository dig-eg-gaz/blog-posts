<div><head>The Fashoda Incident</head>

 <p>I would like to comment on the following section of a page three in my week of newspaper. The entry in the talks about some of the fallout from the infamous â€œFashoda Incident.â€ This event was a territorial dispute between Great Britain and France in Egypt. These two rising world powers had long been rivals and were locked in a colonial competition in Africa. The two had sent expeditions out, Britain moving from North to South and France going West to East. </p>
<p>The two expeditions met in the middle at a fort in Fashoda and after a standoff, agreed to fly both nations flags over the fort rather than go to war. France later withdrew and concessions were made that ended up bringing these former rivals closer together in the face of aggressive German foreign policy. In the context of European politics, the event was the start of something serious and would help to set the stage for World War 1.</p>
<p>After having studied the year of 1905 extensively in a high school European History course, itâ€™s amazing to see this event described in an everyday context. Itâ€™s fascinating to see that an ex-Prime Minister of France would declare England to be in the right, despite the competitive nature of colonial affairs. Itâ€™s a rare thing to see the history that you have studied through the lens of an average citizen in that time period.</p></div>

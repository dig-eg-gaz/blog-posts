The musical theater correspondent surprised me with their knowledge. Growing up, my mom worked in entertainment with a large company, producing theater shows and choreographing many of them. The person writing this well-articulated their points of the show, being critical but also giving a lot of praise. I really felt as if I went to this show, hearing and visualizing the actors throughout.
It was very surprising to me to see such good talent being exhibited during this time period, but also the critic who wrote the excerpt was impressive. I did not know that Egypt had such a well-rounded society with a variety of quality entertainment options.

While digitizing the Tuesday issue of February 5, 1907 of the Egyptian Gazette, the word ‘church’ finally appeared. It was then apparent that this particular newspaper was almost explicitly a secular account of Egyptian life in the early 20th century.  Prior to that, there had apparently been no noteworthy religious days or ceremonies of any kinds.  It was strange to me that there were no advertisements for churches or mosques or temples of any kind.  With Egypt being predominantly under British control by 1907 and the way the newspaper heavily advertised to Western travelers, it would be logical to assume that somewhere there would be mention of religious services.  

The only context in which churches are mentioned are as ‘must sees’ for tourists and a debate in France over when leases of land can be granted for churches.  It wasn’t until the last page, that hotels were advertising ‘English Churches’ as a selling point to market themselves.  These ads were all for hotels in other Western European countries, Switzerland, for example, not Egypt.  

With that being said, what role did religion play in Egyptian life?  Did Christianity have a prominent influence? Was Islam the largest religion practiced? Or a combination? Was polytheism practiced at all still?

This article points to the mixing of science and religion.  The author suggests that religious beliefs, specifically form the Old Testament could be scientifically proven to be plausible.

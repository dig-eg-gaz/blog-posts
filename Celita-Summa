Although there is a constant sense of British imperialism 
evident throughout the Egyptian Gazette, it is very 
interesting the attitude toward this imperialism varies widely 
throughout the paper. For instance, there are many cases 
where the Egyptian Gazette provides long blocks of texts 
or ads clearly targeted toward rich Englishmen. The paper 
then proceeds to provide a sentence-long description of 
an invent important to African natives. This follows with 
the expected traditional convention of the paper, seeing as 
its intended audience was wealthy Westerners. However, it 
was rather surprising to discover a whole column’s length 
worth of information on a book regarding the emancipation 
on Egypt. This article, in the December 26th issue of the
Egyptian Gazette, mentioned both sides of the imperialism 
conflict, saying the author “devotes a whole chapter to the 
‘false position of Great Britain in Egypt.’” The paper devotes
an even greater amount of room to a cluster of articles 
surrounding the death of a khedivial princess. Whether this
great amount of detail is due to the shock value of the event
or the genuine interest in the matter by English businessmen
is open to interpretation. Much of the Egyptian Gazette is 
still written about administration, war, and other topics 
that would mainly be of interest to the white population 
of Alexandria, but these few tidbits to the contrary were
an interesting find.

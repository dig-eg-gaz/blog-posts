                    <p> The lights dim and slowly, the onlooking crowd goes quiet with growing
                        anticipation. The excitable people among the bunch murmur about their
                        excitement to see Signora Pandolfini for their first time as they prepare to
                        hear her sing a soft melody. The people gushing with anticipation hurriedly
                        tell them to shush as they do not want to miss the moment her voice first
                        chirps. The curtains open and just as fast, the tale begins. It’s poetry in
                        motion… sort of. If the crowd’s reaction was anything to go off, Pandolfini
                        really missed the mark on the first act of <hi rend="italic">Madame
                            Butterfly</hi>,a relatively well-known play back in the early 1900s and
                        even now. Back in the early 1900s, the performance had been making the
                        rounds across America and Europe, and it soon found a troop to replicate its
                        excellence in Egypt… for the most part at least. Pandolfini managed to win
                        the crowd over in acts two and three, but the long-awaited play certainly
                        had more than one mishap. While the symphonies played were engaging, many
                        critics said that it left no real impression. This does not equate to bad
                        though, as these same critics believed that the play was truly worthy of
                        playing in the Khedival Theatre. </p>
